# Computer Graphics Masters Project

Welcome to the Computer Graphics Masters Project repository! This project aims to simplify the understanding of computer graphics concepts by providing a structured and comprehensive codebase. Whether you're a student, educator, or enthusiast, this repository serves as a valuable resource for learning and experimenting with various computer graphics topics.

# Objective

The primary objective of this project is to simplify computer graphics concepts for learners at the master's level. By providing a well-organized codebase with detailed explanations and examples, we aim to demystify complex graphics principles and make them accessible to a wider audience.

# Graphics Pipeline

The graphics pipeline is the backbone of any rendering system, responsible for transforming geometric data into pixel colors on the screen. Here's a detailed breakdown of the graphics pipeline stages:

## Vertex Processing:
    Input: Vertices defined in object space.
    Processing: Transformation into clip space using model, view, and projection matrices.
    Output: Transformed vertices in clip space.

## Primitive Assembly:
    Input: Transformed vertices from vertex processing.
    Processing: Assembling vertices into geometric primitives (points, lines, or triangles).
    Output: Primitives ready for rasterization.
## Rasterization:
    Input: Geometric primitives from primitive assembly.
    Processing: Determining which pixels are covered by each primitive.
    Output: Fragments with associated attributes (position, color, depth).
## Fragment Processing:
    Input: Fragments from rasterization.
    Processing: Applying fragment shaders to determine final pixel colors.
    Output: Final pixel colors.
## Framebuffer Operations:
    Input: Final pixel colors from fragment processing.
    Processing: Optional operations like blending, depth testing, and stencil testing.
    Output: Pixel colors displayed on the screen.

# Project Structure

The project is structured into multiple directories, each focusing on a specific computer graphics concept. Here's an overview of the project structure:

- ### src/: Contains source code for each graphics concept.
    - #### `basic_triangle_rendering/`: Demonstrates rendering a basic triangle.
    - #### `texturing/`: Covers texture mapping and sampling techniques.
    - #### `shading/`: Explores different shading models (e.g., Phong, Gouraud).
    - #### `lighting/`: Illustrates various lighting models and techniques.
    - #### `transformations/`: Discusses transformations (translation, rotation, scaling) in 3D graphics.
    - #### `framebuffer_objects/`: Introduces framebuffer objects for off-screen rendering.
    - More concepts`...`

- `external/`: Contains external dependencies such as GLFW and Glad.

- `build/`: Generated by CMake, contains build files.

- `CMakeLists.txt`: Top-level CMake configuration file.

# Getting Started

To get started with the Computer Graphics Masters Project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
Before building the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

    - `CMake`
    - `GLFW`
    - `Glad`

    Installation instructions for these dependencies can typically be found on their respective websites.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
Once you've cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, navigate to the project directory using the terminal or command prompt:

    ```bash
    cd ComputerGraphicsMastersProject
    ```

4. Create a Build Directory:
Create a directory to store the build files. It's a good practice to keep build files separate from the source code. Run the following command to create a build directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    ```
5. Generate Build Files with CMake:
Use CMake to generate the necessary build files (e.g., Makefiles, Visual Studio solution) in the build directory. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    cd build
    cmake ..
    ```
    This command configures the build process based on the project's CMakeLists.txt file.
6. Build the Project:
Once the build files are generated, you can build the project using your preferred build system. For example, if you're using Makefiles, run the following command:

    ```bash
    make
    ```
    If you're using Visual Studio, open the generated solution file and build the project from within the IDE.

7. **Explore Graphics Concepts**:
After successfully building the project, you can explore various graphics concepts by running individual targets. Each concept is organized into its own directory under the `src/` directory. Navigate to the directory of the concept you're interested in and run the corresponding executable.
