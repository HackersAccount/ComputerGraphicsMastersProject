## Introduction

Rendering a basic triangle is often the first step in learning computer graphics programming. This concept provides a simple yet essential example of initializing an OpenGL context, creating a GLFW window, loading OpenGL function pointers with Glad, and rendering a basic geometric shape.

## Prerequisites

Before using this concept, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- C++ compiler (supporting at least C++11)
- GLFW (OpenGL framework)
- Glad (OpenGL loader)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure GLFW and Glad are properly installed and configured in the project.
3. Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler.

## Usage

To run the basic triangle rendering concept:

1. Compile the code using your C++ compiler.
2. Execute the compiled binary.
3. A GLFW window should open, displaying a basic triangle rendered using OpenGL.

## How It Works

The code consists of a single class, `BasicTriangleRendering`, responsible for rendering a basic triangle using OpenGL. Here's an overview of how the code works:

1. **Initialization**: The code initializes GLFW to create a window and sets up an OpenGL context. It then loads OpenGL function pointers using Glad.

2. **Rendering Loop**: The code enters a rendering loop, where it continuously clears the framebuffer, renders a basic triangle, and swaps the front and back buffers to display the rendered image.

3. **Rendering a Triangle**: The `renderTriangle` method defines the vertices of a basic triangle and renders it using OpenGL commands.
